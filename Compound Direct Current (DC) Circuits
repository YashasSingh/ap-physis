### Compound Direct Current (DC) Circuits – AP Physics Notes  

In electrical circuits, compound DC circuits involve multiple components such as resistors, batteries, and sometimes capacitors arranged in series, parallel, or a combination of both. These circuits follow the fundamental principles of Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Laws, and power equations to analyze current, voltage, and resistance.  

#### Key Concepts  

- Ohm’s Law: \( V = IR \), where \( V \) is voltage, \( I \) is current, and \( R \) is resistance.  
- Series Circuits:  
  - The same current flows through all components.  
  - The total resistance is the sum of individual resistances: \( R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots \).  
  - The total voltage across the circuit equals the sum of voltage drops across components.  
- Parallel Circuits:  
  - The voltage across each branch is the same.  
  - The total resistance is found using \( \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \dots \).  
  - The total current is the sum of currents in each branch: \( I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + \dots \).  
- Combination Circuits:  
  - Contain both series and parallel components.  
  - Use Kirchhoff’s Laws to analyze current and voltage distributions.  
- Kirchhoff’s Laws:  
  - Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL): The sum of all voltage drops in a closed loop equals the total supplied voltage.  
  - Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL): The total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving.  
- Power in DC Circuits:  
  - Power is calculated as \( P = IV \), where \( P \) is power in watts.  
  - Alternative forms: \( P = I^2 R \) and \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \).
